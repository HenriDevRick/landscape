This code was made as a result of an assignment and study of Python at Ensign College. This code calculates the area of soil, which is provided by a user, and calculates the number of bags of fertilizers to be used on the soil, the time of the technician's working hours, and the total amount of the technician's payment. Because the data is sensitive, it can only be accessed with credentials, i.e. username and password.
